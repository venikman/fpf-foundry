## F.18 - Local‑First Unification Naming Protocol
*Status: normative (Part F, Unification Suite). Audience: engineer‑managers, lead architects, editors of FPF artefacts.* 

### F.18:1 - Context

Names must carry enough signal for everyday use, yet never smuggle in Cross‑context identities, hidden assumptions, or role/metric clutter. F.18 supplies that naming discipline and weaves it through F.1–F.17: Term Harvesting, Sense Clustering, Role Descriptions, Concept‑Sets, Bridges, Lexical Continuity, Anti‑Explosion control, and the Unified Term Sheet (UTS).

**Scope.** This protocol applies to naming of **any concepts** authored in Part F (U.Types and **local concepts** alike: kinds, roles, services, methods, works, relations, characteristics, states/statuses, etc.). The **U.Types** norms in this section are a **specialization**, not a restriction of scope.

**Purpose of this pattern.** Provide a **human‑legible, context‑anchored naming protocol** that:
* keeps *local meaning first* and prevents Cross‑context conflation;
* makes the **kind** of thing explicit (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Decision, Requirement, etc.);
* integrates smoothly with **Concept-Sets**, **`U.RoleDescription`**, and **Bridges** without requiring any special notation or tooling;
* supports lifecycle actions (mint, reuse, align, deprecate, split/merge) with a paper trail that managers can audit.

### F.18:2 - Problem

Without a shared naming protocol inside Part F, the same recurrent failures appear:

1. **Global‑name illusion.** A short label travels from one context to another and is *assumed* to mean the same thing; later, contradictions surface during acceptance or assurance.
2. **Context drift.** A label gradually changes inside its Context (edition, scope, envelope) without leaving a clean trace; readers argue over “what we meant.”
3. **Kind confusion.** Names hide *what sort of thing* is being named (System vs Episteme vs Role vs Service, etc.), leading to category errors and brittle integration.
4. **Threshold‑in‑the‑name.** Numeric limits, duty segregation, or state qualifiers get baked into names (“Critical‑Reviewer‑0.2 mm”), which cannot age or compose.
5. **Stealth renames.** Quiet label swaps, steered by fashion or politics, sever continuity with earlier evidence, plans, and bridges.
6. **Explosion by synonyms.** Teams mint many near‑synonyms instead of reusing a Concept‑Set row or creating an explicit Bridge with loss notes.

These failures erode trust, block reuse, and make Part F machinery (Concept-Sets, `U.RoleDescription`, Bridges) harder to apply.

### F.18:3 - Forces

| Force                                      | Tension to balance                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local truth vs Cross‑context portability**  | The name must “belong” inside one context while remaining referenceable from other contexts through explicit bridges.               |
| **Human ergonomics vs conceptual clarity** | Short, natural labels help teams move; explicit kind and Context cues keep reasoning sound.                                          |
| **Stability vs evolution**                 | Names should be durable, yet easy to deprecate or refine without breaking links to past evidence and work.                    |
| **Brevity vs auditability**                | A compact “badge” for everyday speech, plus an authoritative **Name Card** that records meaning, scope, edition, and lineage. |
| **Parsimony vs inclusivity**               | Reuse existing Concept‑Set rows where possible; mint new names only when indispensable in the local context.                     |

### F.18:4 - Solution — The Local‑First Naming Protocol

F.18 defines **eight rules** (R‑rules) and **six practices** (P‑practices). Together they produce **Name Cards** that any reader can interpret **ontologically** without guessing, and that slot cleanly into the rest of Part F.

**Path Card (subset of Name Card).** A **Name Card** whose **object‑of‑talk/entity-of-interest** is an **EvidenceGraph Path**: it cites a **PathId** (or **PathSliceId**), **Context**, **ReferencePlane**, **Γ_time**, and any **Bridge id(s) + CL/CL^plane** (with loss notes). Used by **G.6** and **G.10** to make justifications portable on UTS.

#### F.18:4.1 - The Eight R‑rules (normative)

**R1 — Speak every name *with its Context*.**
A name is **never** context‑free. When you introduce or use a name, **pair it with the Bounded Context** where it lives (the “Context of meaning”), and with the **edition** of that Context if relevant. In everyday speech: “X, *in* Y.” Cross‑context use requires a Bridge; labels alone do not travel. 

**R2 — State the ontological *Kind* on the Card.**
Every Name Card **must** state the **Kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, etc.). This prevents category errors and keeps Role–Method–Work alignment clean. *Clarification:* this is a **Card requirement**, not a demand that the label string begin with the Kind.

**R3 — Declare the *Purpose / use‑domain* on the Card.**
In addition to **Kind**, the Name Card **must** state the intended **Purpose / use‑domain** that situates the concept in practice and signals **which families of contexts** are expected to use it (e.g., mathematical formalism, engineering practice, computer science, systems management). This enables reconstruction of usage from the lexicon and reduces unintended scope drift. *Clarification:* this is a **Card field**; it does **not** require the label string to carry the purpose qualifier.

**R4 — Resolve the name to a *Local‑Sense*.**
A minted name must resolve to a Local-Sense inside its Context (the result of F.2–F.3). If a name points to a Role Description, state that template and its sense basis. Avoid heavily overloaded surface terms: when needed, prefer concise two-word Tech labels that hint at the intended sense.

**R5 — Use *Twin Registers* (Unified Tech + Plain).**
Provide two human‑oriented labels on the Name Card, per **E.10** register discipline:
* a **Unified Tech** label (short, morphology‑stable, neutral in wording);
* a **Plain** label (reader‑friendly phrasing for managers and subject‑matter experts).

The **Unified Tech** label is the only one used in **Core** normative prose; **Plain** is for teaching and examples. Both remain **context‑local**; neither establishes Cross‑context identity (that is the job of the **UTS row** and **Bridges**).

**R6 — Keep thresholds and states *out of the name*.**
Do not encode numeric limits, separation‑of‑duties, or readiness states in the label. Put thresholds on **Method steps** (capability/acceptance), states in **Role State Graphs**, and SoD via **incompatibility** relations. Names carry *what this is* and *which Context claims it*—not *when and how it may act*.

**R7 — Cross‑context only by *Bridge* with loss notes.**
When another Context needs to reference a name, use an **Alignment Bridge** that states the relation (equivalent, narrower, broader, analogous) and its **Congruence Level** with explicit **loss/fit** annotations. Never equate two names by label alone.

**R8 — Make renames and merges *first‑class events*.**
When a label changes, or two labels consolidate or split, record it on the Name Card as a lifecycle action (rename, merge, split, retire) with rationale and dates. Past uses *remain valid as historical facts*; continuity comes from lineage, not silent edits.

#### F.18:4.2 - The Six P‑practices (normative process)

**P1 — Candidate set (*NQD-front* of seed-words).**
Do **not** pick a label “in one shot”. Build a **small, non-dominated candidate set** (an *NQD-front*, typically 5–10 items) by seeding and varying along:
**Traditions** — mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, systems thinking, management, etc. with their typical contexts and situations; use maximum diversity here;
 **Novelty/Familiarity** — from careful **reuse** of established terms to sharper **neologisms** from recent SoTA traditions;  
 **Lexical form** — distinct **head terms** and morpheme families, readability/pronounceability, inflection/declension, transparency.
Use the **Novelty–Quality–Diversity** discipline from **Part G** to maintain only **non-dominated** candidates; when appropriate, you may implement this via **Γ_nqd.generate (G.18)**. Record the **seeds** and the short rationale in the Card’s notes. Choose final **Unified Tech**/**Plain** labels **from this frontier**; if a strong candidate is discarded, briefly note why.

For the purposes of **Diversity_P**, group candidates into **head-term families** (same base noun/verb + minor prepositions or case endings). Variants such as *“Reference plane”*, *“Plane of reference”* and *“Referred plane”* **count as one family**, not three distinct candidates. An NQD-front with multiple near-clones from one family **does not** satisfy the diversity requirement. Aim for **≥ 3 distinct head-term families** in the CandidateSet; if the front ends up with fewer families (e.g. due to a very narrow domain or strong AliasRisk on other heads), the Name Card **MUST** record a brief rationale in the NQD-front notes.

**Lexical Q‑axes for the NQD‑front**
When P1 uses **NQD‑CAL (C.18)**, treat the **Quality vector** over candidates as part of the same archive as C.18’s **NQD‑frontier**. Recommended axes (all **ordinal; no arithmetic means**):

 * **SemanticFidelity (P — Ontological precision).**
  *Question.* Does the label verify against the **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** and Concept‑Set row without adding or losing core invariants?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Misleading, Vague, Precise, Exact}` with `Exact ≻ Precise ≻ Vague ≻ Misleading`.  
  *Link to P2.* When **P2** is run, derive the SemanticFidelity rating from the per‑sense‑seed judgements: candidates with any **core** sense‑seeds classified as `wrong‑prototype` **MUST** be rated **Misleading**; candidates rated **SemanticFidelity ≥ Precise** **SHOULD** have at least a configurable fraction `θ_P` (default `θ_P = 0.7`) of sense‑seeds in `on‑target` and **NONE** in `wrong‑prototype`. Discard candidates that remain **Misleading** after revision.

* **CognitiveErgonomics (S — Sociolinguistic admissibility).**  
  *Question.* Can the target **RoleEnactors** (engineers, managers) read, pronounce, and recall the label without specialist training?  
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Alienating, Jargon, Acceptable, Natural}` with `Natural ≻ Acceptable ≻ Jargon ≻ Alienating`. Prefer labels **≥ Acceptable** in the home Context.

* **OperationalAffordance (O — Morphological/action alignment).**
  *Question.* Does the morphology of the label hint at its role in **methods/morphisms** (object vs process vs result) and support the required derivational family (noun/verb/participial forms)?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Opaque, Role‑hinting, Action‑aligned}`. Action‑aligned labels make it obvious whether we are naming an **actor**, an **activity**, or an **artifact** (e.g., *Author* vs *Authoring* vs *AuthoredArtifact*).  
  *Kind‑sensitive cues.* When the **Kind** on the Card is a **Role**, prefer agentive/holder morphology (*…Role*, *…er*, *…or* or local equivalents); when the Kind is **Method/MethodDescription**, prefer verbal or gerundive forms; when the Kind is **Holon**, prefer result nouns, when **Work**, prefer verb. Misaligned morphology (e.g., a Role named with a pure process noun) should be treated as a **penalty on OperationalAffordance** and, if retained for legacy or regulatory reasons, called out explicitly in **Card notes**. See F.5/F.11/F.12 and **LEX‑BUNDLE §8**.

* **AliasRisk (A — Lexical overload).**  
  *Question.* How likely is a careful reader to import a **wrong sense** from neighbouring FPF artefacts or external canons when they see this string?  
  *Scale (ordinal; ↓ better).* `{Safe, Context‑dependent, High‑Risk, Overloaded}` with `Safe ≻ Context‑dependent ≻ High‑Risk ≻ Overloaded`. Avoid adopting **Overloaded** labels unless required by legacy and called out explicitly in notes. When C.18’s **DomainDiversitySignature** is available, AliasRisk MAY be refined into a CHR‑typed characteristic with the same polarity.

Use these axes for **Pareto comparison only** (per **C.16** ordinal discipline). Do **not** collapse them into a single scalar score; the NQD‑front is computed over the **vector of lexical Q‑components** together with **Novelty** and **Diversity_P**.

**P2 — Semantic read‑through against archetypal situations.**  
Alongside the NQD‑front of label candidates, maintain a **small set of 5–10 archetypal situations** (“**sense‑seeds**”) that instantiate the intended use (purpose) across different traditions. For **each** candidate label and each sense‑seed, perform a **read‑through test**:  
– write **1–2 short example sentences per sense‑seed** (e.g., “In case X, we perform \<Label\>”);  
– classify the outcome, for a careful reader in the home Context, as one of `{too‑narrow, on‑target, too‑wide, wrong‑prototype}`.  
Maintain, on the Name Card, a small tally per candidate of how many sense‑seeds fall into each class. Use these tallies both to **prune candidates** and to instantiate **SemanticFidelity** (P‑axis): labels with a sustained pattern of `wrong‑prototype` hits on core sense‑seeds **SHALL** be removed from the NQD‑front (or kept only as deprecated aliases with an explicit warning). Candidates rated **SemanticFidelity ≥ Precise** **SHOULD** satisfy the `θ_P` constraint from the SemanticFidelity definition (fraction of `on‑target` seeds) and have no `wrong‑prototype` counts.  
Record **rejected candidates** and their **mismatch patterns** in the Name Card’s **NQD‑front notes**.

**P3 — Mint‑or‑Reuse gate (F.8).**
Before minting, search your Context’s **Concept‑Set table**. If a row already covers your sense, reuse it and only add a **local label**. If not, propose a **new row** and capture the decision in a brief rationale.

**P4 — Concept‑Set linkage (F.7).**
Every Name Card **must** indicate its Concept‑Set row (or record “not applicable” for intentionally Context‑unique names). This is the handle for alignment and anti‑explosion control.

**P5 — UTS registration (F.17).**
Publish each Name Card to the **Unified Term Sheet** with Context, kind, twin labels, sense anchor, edition, and lifecycle status. Keep the UTS the single, human‑readable table of record.

**P6 — Lifecycle hygiene (F.13).**
Apply the same discipline to renames, splits/merges, and retirements; leave a forward/backward pointer so readers can trace continuity at a glance.

### F.18:5 - The Name Card (authoring template, representation-agnostic)

#### F.18:5.1 - Card purpose & mode guard (normative)

To prevent “post-hoc justification” of intuitively chosen labels, every **Name Card** SHALL declare its
**CardMode ∈ {MintNew, DocumentLegacy}**:

* **MintNew.** The Card is the **output of an NQD-style lexical search** over a **candidate label set** generated inside
  the home Context(s), using the lexical Q-tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, OperationalAffordance,
  AliasRisk}` together with **Novelty (N)** and **Diversity_P** (per A.0 / C.17–C.18 / B.5.2.1).  
  – The Card SHALL record:  
    – a minimal **CandidateSet** (the labels actually evaluated), with **head-term family** tags for each candidate;  
    – the resulting **NQD-front** of **non-dominated candidates** over ⟨Q-tuple, N, Diversity_P⟩;  
    – a short **selection note** explaining why the chosen Tech/Plain pair was picked from that front
      (e.g., “better CognitiveErgonomics at equal SemanticFidelity”).  
 
  – A single-element NQD-front is permitted only if the Card records a brief rationale why **no alternative candidate
    survived** the lexical and NQD filters (e.g., legacy constraints, strong AliasRisk on all other options).

* **DocumentLegacy.** The Card documents an **externally imposed legacy label** (e.g., a regulatory or de facto Standard)
  and its mapping to FPF structures. In this mode the Card MAY omit a full NQD-front, but SHALL:  
  – state the **legacy source / provenance**;  
  – either (i) provide at least a **sketched NQD-comparison** of viable internal variants against the legacy label, or  
    (ii) record a short **out-of-scope rationale** (e.g., “name frozen by law; see cited Standard”) explaining why NQD
    search is not being used for selection.

For all **Core-surface naming of U.Types and other canonical FPF concepts**, **MintNew** is the **default** CardMode; using
DocumentLegacy for such names requires an explicit justification on the Card.

A **Name Card** is the authoritative, human‑readable record of a name inside its Context. It has these fields; teams may add local notes.

1. **Row ID** — the stable, opaque **UTS row identifier** (the identity anchor).
2. **Twin labels** — **Unified Tech** and **Plain** (per E.10).
3. **Context of meaning** — the Bounded Context and, if relevant, its edition.
4. **Kind** — what sort of thing this is (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, etc.). This is an **ontological category**, not a surface‑string prefix. 
5. **Purpose / use‑domain** — the intended area(s) of use (which families of contexts are expected to use it).
6. **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** — one‑paragraph intended sense in the home context (no tool/process slang).
7. **Didactic subtitle** — ≤ 12 words that signal pragmatic use.
8. **Sense reference** — a Local‑Sense reference (how F.2–F.3 clustered it).
9. **Concept‑Set linkage** — Concept‑Set reference or “not applicable” (with rationale).
10. **Alignment note** — if a Bridge exists to other Contexts, cite it and record **loss/fit** in plain words (no formulas required on the Card).
11. **Relation kind** — if the name is for a relation, declare **structural** vs **epistemic** and `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`. For **structural** relations, provide **Constructive** grounding (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`). If the name is not for a relation with arity ≥ 2, set this field to “n/a”.
12. **Manager’s clip** — one‑line “use/avoid” guidance for everyday communication.
13. **Archetypal situations (sense‑seeds)** — **5-10 short “X‑case” lines** used by **P2** for the semantic read‑through; keep them **edition‑aware** and **context‑local**.
14. **NQD‑front seeds** — brief rationale for discarded candidates (**include mismatch patterns from P2 and any lexical Q‑scores used in P1**).
15. **SemanticFidelity/CognitiveErgonomics/OperationalAffordance/AliasRisk** scores for the NQD-front labels.
16. **Version**  — current status and history of editions.
17. **Card notes** — optional free text with comments about the name (e.g., recommended translations, etymology, pronunciation). 

**Manager’s reading habit.** When two names collide in a meeting, ask for their **Context**, **Kind**, **Purpose/use‑domain**, and **Sense anchor**. If any of those differ, you are comparing different things; switch to **Bridge** talk, not label talk.

### F.18:6 - What *belongs* in the label—and what does not

**Belongs (keeps the label clean and durable):**

* The **core head word** that names the thing *(the **Kind** is recorded on the Card; the string need not encode it)* (e.g., “Pump”, “Standard”, “Requirement”, “Surgeon”, “Cooling”).
* A **purpose qualifier** if it is essential to the local sense and stable across editions (e.g., “Cooling” vs “Fuel”).
* A **scope qualifier** only if it is part of the *meaning* rather than the current plan (“Surgical Ward” rather than dates or batch numbers).

**Does not belong (move elsewhere):**

* **Numbers and thresholds** (put on steps, capabilities, acceptance clauses).
* **States** (use Role State Graphs and checklists).
* **Temporal windows** (work plans and history).
* **Organisational authorisations** (speech acts and assignments).
* **Imported acronyms** from other Contexts (use Bridges with loss notes instead).

**Quick litmus for authors.** If removing a number, date, or state *does not* change the *meaning* of the thing, it should **not** be in the label.

### F.18:7 - Worked triad (three short, context‑local examples)

*(Names below are illustrative; the same words in other Contexts may mean something else. The point is how the Name Card keeps them clear.)*

#### F.18:7.1 - Industrial operations Context: “Thermal Management - 2026”

* **Kind:** Service
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** industrial thermal utilities; line‑level planning and operations
* **Unified Tech label:** Cooling Supply
* **Plain label:** Chilled water for line B
* **Sense anchor:** supply of water at defined temperature/flow to boundary B
* **Concept‑Set:** “Utility service” row; local variant recorded
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Plant Utilities - 2026” notes that “Cooling Supply” there bundles filtration; *loss:* filtration is not guaranteed in this Context
* **Version:** 20 Feb 2024
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Cooling Supply*, *Chilled Water Service*, *Process Cooling*, *Cooling Utility*. **Chosen:** *Cooling Supply* (neutral, morphology‑stable).

**Why it’s good.** The label doesn’t encode temperature or flow limits (those live in acceptance). It names a Service; nobody will confuse it with a pump System or a Method.

#### F.18:7.2 - Clinical Context: “Hospital OR - 2026”

* **Kind:** Role
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** OR governance and staffing; credentialing and checklists
* **Unified Tech label:** Surgeon Role
* **Plain label:** Operating surgeon
* **Sense anchor:** person who is authorised to perform surgical steps under defined checks
* **Concept‑Set:** “Clinical roles” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Training & Credentialing - 2026” shows partial overlap; *loss:* that Context’s “Senior Surgeon” carries teaching duties that do not apply here
* **Version:** Feb 2025; renamed‑from “Lead Surgeon” (2025) with rationale: avoided “lead” vs “operating” ambiguity
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Surgeon Role*, *Operating Surgeon*, *Primary Surgeon*, *Operating Physician*. **Chosen:** *Surgeon Role* (Kind‑neutral string; Plain clarifies).
*Lexical Q snapshot (PSOA‑style, informative).*  

| Candidate | SF | CE | OA | A‑Risk | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Surgeon Role | Precise | Acceptable | Role‑hinting | Safe | Neutral head noun; morphology matches **Role** Kind; works across departments. |
| Operating Surgeon | Precise | Natural | Role‑hinting | Context‑dependent | Reads well, but “operating” competes with “operating theatre/room”; kept as Plain label only. |
| Primary Surgeon | Vague | Natural | Role‑hinting | Context‑dependent | “Primary” ambiguous (training vs shift); rejected for governance vocabulary. |
| Operating Physician | Vague | Jargon | Role‑hinting | High‑Risk | Collides with non‑surgical physician roles; rejected despite familiarity in some hospitals. |
 
**Why it’s good.** No fatigue thresholds or readiness states in the name; those live in the Role’s state graph and checklists.

#### F.18:7.3 - Public service Context: “Civic Services - 2026”

* **Kind:** Requirement
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** service performance management; public service SLAs
* **Unified Tech label:** Passport Lead‑Time
* **Plain label:** Time to issue a passport
* **Sense anchor:** elapsed time from complete application to issuance
* **Concept‑Set:** “Service quality requirements” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Legal Framework - 2026” records that legal “deadline” has different remedies; *loss:* legal exemptions not carried into this Context
* **Version:** current
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Passport Lead‑Time*, *Issuance Time*, *Service Turnaround*, *Time to Issue Passport*. **Chosen:** *Passport Lead‑Time* (neutral; Plain remains didactic).

**Why it’s good.** Target values (e.g., ≤ 20 days) are not in the label; they live in acceptance clauses.


### F.18:8 - Conformance Checklist (editor aid) — *Part I: naming & cards* (**non‑normative**)

**CCE‑F18.1 (Context pairing).**
Every name used in normative text **must** be paired with its **Context of meaning**. If you cannot name the Context, you do not have a valid name.

**CCE‑F18.2 (Kind clarity).**
Every Name Card **must** state the **kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, …). Using labels that hide kind is non‑conformant.

**CCE‑F18.2a (Purpose declared).**
Every Name Card **must** state the **Purpose / use‑domain** (families of contexts where the concept is expected to be used). Omitting Purpose is non‑conformant.

**CCE‑F18.3 (Sense anchoring).**
A minted name **must** resolve to a **Local‑Sense** in its Context. If a sense cannot be stated, label minting is deferred.

**CCE‑F18.4 (Twin registers).**
Each Name Card carries a **Unified Tech** and a **Plain** label (E.10). Tech appears in **Core** prose; Plain in teaching/examples.

**CCE‑F18.5 (No thresholds/states in labels).**
Numeric limits, readiness states, and separation‑of‑duties **must not** appear in labels. Put them on steps, checklists, and role algebra.

**CCE‑F18.6 (Bridge‑only travel).**
Cross‑context reuse of a name **must** go through an **Alignment Bridge** with an explicit relation and **loss/fit** notes. Label matching alone is forbidden.

**CCE‑F18.7 (Lifecycle visibility).**
Renames, splits/merges, and retirements **must** be recorded on the Name Card with dates and rationale. Past occurrences remain valid as historical facts.

**CCE‑F18.8 (Mint‑or‑Reuse gate).**
Before minting, authors **must** check the Context’s Concept‑Set table; if a row exists, **reuse** it with a local label unless a documented reason compels a new row.

**CCE‑F18.9 (UTS entry).**
Names used in normative artefacts **must** appear on the **Unified Term Sheet** with the specified **Name‑Card fields**; include Notes when present).

**CCE‑F18.10 (No cross‑kind labels).**
Do not reuse the same **Unified Tech label** for different kinds inside one context (e.g., “Cooling” as a Service and as a Method). If unavoidable, add a stable qualifier to disambiguate and record the decision on both Name Cards.

**CCE‑F18.11 (Manager’s clip).**
Each Name Card **should** carry a one‑line “use/avoid” note to guide everyday speech. Where omitted, editors add it during review.

**CCE‑F18.12 (Anti‑explosion check).**
If three or more near‑synonyms for the same Local‑Sense appear in drafts, authors **must** either consolidate to one label or record an intentional synonym pair with use/avoid notes and a plan to converge.

### F.18:9 - Normative Standard (what must be true)

> This section is binding. It specifies the publication Standard for unification‑oriented names in the Unification Suite (Part F), with **local‑first authority**, **bounded context clarity**, and **one‑way unification** upwards along the ladder. It complements, and does not replace, the structural and epistemic Standards elsewhere in FPF.

**9.1 Local authority & home.**
Every unification name has a **single home**: exactly one *Bounded Context* that authors and stewards it. The home is responsible for the definition, examples, and lifecycle of the name. Cross‑context reuse happens by **bridges**, not by relocating the home.

**9.2 Minimum definitional payload.**
A published name MUST ship with a human‑readable **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** that states the intended sense in the home context, and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words) that signals its pragmatic use. The MDS must be free of process slang and implementation jargon.

**9.3 Row ID + label surfaces.**
For each adopted name, the home supplies:
* a **Row ID** (the opaque UTS identifier — the **identity anchor**), and
* two **label surfaces**: a **Unified Tech** label (for Core prose) and a **Plain** label (for teaching).
  Both labels refer to the same underlying sense; **Plain** may simplify terms, not premises.

**9.4 One‑way dependencies.**
Each rung on the ladder depends only **downwards**: a name at rung *n* can rely on names ratified at rungs ≤ *n*, never sideways or upwards. Cycles are prohibited. If a dependency is not yet ratified at the required rung, the new name remains Draft or Pilot.

**9.5 Local‑first before reuse.**
Teams MUST first **identify and stabilize the local sense** (within their Bounded Context). **Within the home**, reuse existing **Concept‑Set rows** where they fit (§4.2 **P1**). **Across contexts**, reuse occurs via **Alignment Bridges** that map the local sense to an existing sense elsewhere—without collapsing the local home.

**9.6 Sense, not string.**
Publication concerns **sense** (intended meaning in context), not the literal string. Synonyms are allowed as **Plain** labels or **aliases** only if they point to the same **Row ID** and pass the conformance checks in §15 (“CC‑F18”). Strings must not be treated as identity.

**9.7 Relation-kind discipline (structural vs epistemic).**
If the public name surfaces a **structural relation**, its intended sense **MUST** be backed by *exactly one Constructive trace* in the structural calculus (Compose-CAL) and **SHALL** declare `validationMode=axiomatic` (see E.14). If the name surfaces an **epistemic relation**, Constructive backing is optional; **declare** `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}` and use **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** as appropriate. **Do not mix relation kinds** inside a single name. *(Do not use “Tier-1/2”; formality is expressed via F per C.2.3.)*

**9.8 Member vs Component.**
Names that describe collection membership MUST NOT be used to imply part‑whole structure, and vice versa. If both aspects are needed, publish two names with their own MDS and an explicit bridge.

**9.9 Lifecycle states.**
A name travels through **Idea → Draft → Pilot → Ratified → Deprecated**. Transitions require explicit human review gates. Ratified names carry a clear stewardship contact and date.

**9.10 Anti‑duplication duty.**
Before ratification, the home MUST perform a **near‑neighbor review**: identify adjacent names, record the decision to align, merge, or keep separate, and publish the rationale in the name’s record.

**9.11 Local clarity over global neatness.**
When in doubt, prefer **local intelligibility** for practitioners over global symmetry. Global neatness can be achieved later via bridges; loss of local sense is hard to repair.

**9.12 No imported tool terms in Core names.**
Names and their MDS must not carry terms whose only meaning is tied to operating tools or pipelines. If such terms are unavoidable in pedagogy, confine them to Working-Names and examples with disclaimers.

**9.13 Human‑only conformance.**
Conformance for this protocol is judged by trained human reviewers using the author/reviewer checklists in §14 and the conformance criteria in §15 (“CC‑F18”). Automated heuristics, if any exist in an organization, have no standing in the Core.

### F.18:10 - Rationale (why this exists and why these rules)

**10.1 Local‑first unlocks velocity without lexical debt.**
Centralized naming regimes seem tidy but slow learning and create brittle compromises. Local‑first minting lets teams speak clearly **now**; unification comes from disciplined bridges and one‑way dependencies, not from premature centralization.

**10.2 One home lowers ambiguity.**
Names with “many owners” drift. A **single home** concentrates accountability for sense, examples, and lifecycle, while still enabling broad reuse via alignment bridges.

**10.3 Unified Tech + Plain serve two audiences.**
Engineers need **precise** wording; managers and stakeholders need **approachable** wording. Splitting the surfaces keeps the same sense while protecting accuracy and pedagogy; both are anchored by the **Row ID**.

**10.4 One‑way ladder prevents conceptual knots.**
Acyclic dependencies cut off circular definitions and policy deadlocks. The ladder provides a simple mental model: *build on what is already firm*.

**10.5 Relation-kind discipline prevents category errors.**
Part-whole claims **(structural)** must rest on **Constructive** grounds (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`, `validationMode=axiomatic`). Experience-based or evaluative relations **(epistemic)** follow assurance rules (**Logical/Mapping**, and **Empirical Validation** when *postulate*), with an explicit `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. Mixing relation kinds inside a single name confuses review and invites hidden assumptions. 

**10.6 Sense over string reduces false conflicts.**
Disputes often orbit the string (“we hate that word”). By separating **sense** (what we mean) from **string** (how we say it), the protocol enables peaceful coexistence: keep the **Row ID** constant; use one **Plain** label and, where helpful, a budgeted **alias** per register.


### F.18:11 - Application Guidance (how to apply, step by step)

**11.1 Prepare (30–60 min).**

* Clarify **your Bounded Context** and audience.
* Collect 2–3 typical user stories that require the name.
* Scan near‑neighbors in adjacent contexts (see §14.2 Reviewer checklist).

**11.2 Mint locally.**

* Write the **MDS** in plain language, one paragraph.
* Draft a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words): “what this name buys you.”
* Decide whether the intended **relation kind** is **structural** or **epistemic** (do not mix), and declare `validationMode`.

**11.3 Choose surfaces.**

* **Unified Tech label**: concise, morphology‑stable, neutral; avoid metaphor.
* **Plain label**: approachable phrasing for non‑specialists.
* **How to choose**: pick both **from a small NQD‑frontier** (see §4.2 P1 (candidate set), P2(read-through)): diversify by tradition, novelty/familiarity, and lexical form; record discarded contenders and rationale on the Card.

**11.4 Place on the ladder.**

* Verify all dependencies are at the same rung or below.
* If a dependency is still Draft/Pilot, keep this name at most Pilot.

**11.5 Align, don’t erase.**

* Where overlap exists with another context, propose an **alignment bridge**.
* Keep your home; record the mapping and any known divergence in reading.

**11.6 Publish and steward.**

* Publish the name with MDS, subtitle, rung, home contact, examples.
* Schedule a **first refresh**: when should the home examine usage and drift?

**11.7 Deprecate gracefully.**

* If the sense is superseded, publish **Deprecation Notes**: what to use instead, and why. Keep old Working-Names visible long enough to allow safe migration.

**11.8 The “Friday test.”**

* On a busy Friday, could a competent colleague apply the name correctly using only the MDS, subtitle, and two examples? If not, refine before ratification: it too overloaded with meanings to be helpful.

### F.18:12 - Examples (worked mini‑cases for engineer‑managers)

> These examples are deliberately simple. They show how local‑first minting, one‑way unification, and tier discipline operate together.

**12.1 “Module” vs “Component” (engineering structure).**

* *Home A (Platform)* mints **Component** with MDS: “A physically or logically integrated part whose removal would alter the integrity of the whole.” **Structural**.
* *Home B (App Team)* mints **Module** with MDS: “A deployable bundle of functionality maintained as a unit.” **Epistemic** (usage practice), not a structural claim.
* **Unification:** An alignment bridge states: “In Platform, every Component may host one or more Modules; Modules are not Parts.” Dependencies are one‑way: *Module* depends on *Component*; *Component* does not depend on *Module*. No synonymy asserted. Both names remain in their homes.

**12.2 “Incident” vs “Event” (operational sense).**

* *Home C (Operations)* mints **Incident** with MDS: “An unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of a service.” **Epistemic**.
* *Home D (Monitoring)* mints **Event** with MDS: “A recorded observation of a state change in a system.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge notes: “Some Events are Incidents when they degrade service; not all Events are Incidents.” **Plain** labels (and at most one alias per register) may vary (e.g., “Outage” as an alias for **Incident**), but the **Row IDs** stay distinct. No part‑whole claims are implied.

**12.3 “Customer” vs “Account Holder” (business roles).**

* *Home E (Sales)* mints **Customer**: “A party that receives value from an offering in exchange for consideration.” **Epistemic**.
* *Home F (Finance)* mints **Account Holder**: “A party legally responsible for an account.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge states overlaps and divergence: “A Customer can be an Account Holder; an Account Holder may not be a Customer (e.g., trustee).” The homes retain stewardship; a shared Working-Name “Client” may be used in executive materials with a clear note: **Working-Name only; see Concept-IDs for decisions**.

**12.4 “Batch” vs “Lot” (collection vs integration).**

* *Home G (Manufacturing)* mints **Batch**: “A collection of items produced under shared conditions.” **Epistemic membership**.
* *Home H (Quality)* mints **Lot**: “An integrated whole packaged and tracked as one item.” **Structural whole**.
* **Unification:** Bridge notes: “A **Lot** may originate from a single **Batch** or a slice of a Batch; not every Batch yields a single Lot.” Relation mapping: **MemberOf** (Batch membership) vs **ComponentOf**/**Whole** (Lot integration). *Loss note:* membership evidence does **not** imply part‑whole structure; part‑whole structure does **not** imply shared production conditions.

### F.18:13 - Anti‑Patterns & Failure Modes (what to avoid)

**13.1 “Global name first.”**
Trying to coin a single global string before local understanding is mature. **Fix:** mint locally, publish MDS, then align.

**13.2 “Synonym storm.”**
Collecting many strings without stabilizing the Concept-ID. **Fix:** one Concept-ID per sense; multiple Working-Names only if they truly help didactics.

**13.3 “Process leakage into names.”**
Burying workflow or tool steps inside the MDS. **Fix:** keep process in method descriptions; keep names about sense, not procedure.

**13.4 “Member‑implies‑part.”**
Letting collection names induce part‑whole claims. **Fix:** separate names, separate MDS; don’t smuggle structure into membership.

**13.5 “Sideways dependency.”**
Defining a name by appealing to another Draft at the same rung or higher. **Fix:** depend only downward or postpone ratification.

**13.6 “Alias/Plain drift.”**
Letting a Plain label or alias accumulate extra meanings absent in the underlying row. **Fix:** periodic label review; prune metaphors that start bending sense; respect the alias budget.

### F.18:14 - Assurance & Conformance (human‑only checks)

#### F.18:14.1 - Author checklist (before requesting review).

* [ ] I identified the **home Bounded Context** and audience.
* [ ] I wrote a clear **MDS** (≤ 1 paragraph) and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words).
* [ ] I declared the **relation kind** (structural vs epistemic) and the **validationMode**; no mixing.
* [ ] If **structural**, I can point to **exactly one Constructive trace** that backs the structural claim.
* [ ] I surveyed near‑neighbors and recorded my decision to align, merge, or keep separate.
* [ ] I produced both **Unified Tech** and **Plain** labels (per E.10), with the same sense and pointing to the same **Row ID**.
* [ ] Dependencies point **only downward**; no sideways or upward pulls.
* [ ] I scheduled a **refresh date** and listed 2–3 usage examples.

#### F.18:14.2 - Reviewer checklist (at the gate).**

* [ ] One home is declared; stewardship contact is clear.
* [ ] The MDS is free from process jargon and implementation slang.
* [ ] The declared **relation kind** is justified; **structural** claims are constructively grounded; **epistemic** claims declare `validationMode` and evidential posture.
* [ ] Member vs Component is respected where relevant.
* [ ] Alignment bridges are proposed where overlap exists, with explicit reading of convergence/divergence.
* [ ] The ladder discipline holds: acyclic, downward‑only dependencies.
* [ ] The **Plain** label does not smuggle extra commitments; **Unified Tech** and **Plain** remain co‑referential and point to the same **Row ID**.
* [ ] Lifecycle state is accurate (Idea/Draft/Pilot/Ratified/Deprecated) and dated.

#### F.18:14.3 - Lightweight outcomes.**

* **Ratify** (meets all checks).
* **Pilot** (publish with explicit questions and a refresh date).
* **Revise** (return to author with targeted gaps).
* **Merge** (replace with an alignment to an existing name).
* **Deprecate** (publish successor guidance and sunset plan).

### F.18:15 - Conformance Criteria (normative “CC‑F18”)

> These are **language‑level** obligations for authors and reviewers. They ensure every unified name is **local‑first**, **bridge‑aware**, and **teachable**.

**CC‑F18‑1 (Context first).** Every unified name **SHALL** be grounded in **local senses** that were harvested and clustered **inside named Contexts** (“context of meaning”) prior to unification. No name may be minted from free‑floating glosses or Cross‑context intuition. Use F.1–F.3 first.

**CC‑F18‑2 (Bridge‑only sameness).** Claims of sameness across Contexts **SHALL** be expressed only via explicit **Bridges** with a stated congruence and loss note. Mere spelling similarity never licenses a unified name. Use F.9.

**CC‑F18‑3 (Twin‑register naming).** Each unified concept **SHALL** carry **two labels**—a **Unified Tech** label (used in Core prose) and a **Plain** label (used for teaching). Labels are chosen per the naming discipline of F.5 and the register rules of **E.10**.

**CC‑F18‑4 (Neutrality of the Tech label).** The **Unified Tech** label **SHALL NOT** be borrowed wholesale from any single source Context where that borrowing would re‑import that Context’s private distinctions. Prefer a **neutral** term; **Cross‑context reuse occurs only via the UTS row and explicit Bridges**. (See F.5 “allowed/forbidden forms”.)

**CC‑F18‑5 (One concept per row, one Tech label per row).** A unified concept **SHALL** be captured as **one Concept‑Set row** in the **UTS**. Exactly **one Unified Tech label** is normative for that row; additional legacy strings are aliases in Annex (budgeted). Use F.7 with F.17.

**CC‑F18‑6 (SenseCell citations).** For each unified name, the **SenseCells** (Context × Local‑Sense) that justify it **SHALL** be cited in the UTS row with **Context name + edition**. Omit edition only if the Context has a single stable edition. See F.17 §6.

**CC‑F18‑7 (Sheet‑level coverage).** Within a thread’s UTS, the **set of rows** carrying unified names **SHALL** collectively cite **≥ 3 distinct Contexts**, ensuring breadth of evidence. Coverage is a property of the **sheet**, not of every single row. See F.17 §6 constraint.

**CC‑F18‑8 (No global words).** In Core text, **“Context” always means `U.BoundedContext`**; **discipline columns** may be used in teaching layouts but **is not** a bearer of meaning. Do not write context‑free claims of sameness. See E.10 and F.17 §5.

**CC‑F18‑9 (Didactic primacy).** A unified name **SHALL** be teachable on **one page**: its **UTS row** + a short narrative that a careful reader can replay (F.16 template). If it cannot be taught concisely, the naming attempt is premature.

**CC‑F18‑10 (No lifecycle connotations).** Names **SHALL NOT** encode imagined “maturity stages” or time‑ordering unless those are part of the concept’s intension. Stages belong in **state‑space** and dynamics narratives, not in names. (See A‑series CHR patterns.)

**CC‑F18‑11 (Strict distinction guard).** Names **SHALL** respect **A.7 Strict Distinction**: do not collapse **Role ↔ Method ↔ Work** or **Status ↔ Description** into one word. Align with F.11/F.12 where relevant.

**CC‑F18‑12 (Change control via F.13).** Renames, splits, merges, and retirements **SHALL** follow F.13’s lexical continuity rules; the UTS remains the canonical public surface for these changes.

**CC‑F18‑13 (Lexical Pareto discipline).** When a Name Card uses **NQD‑CAL (C.18)** to score label candidates, the **chosen Unified Tech label** **SHALL** lie on the **Pareto frontier** of the lexical Q‑tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, OperationalAffordance, AliasRisk}` (per **C.16** ordinal discipline and P1’s NQD‑front definition), unless an explicit exception is recorded. If authors deliberately select a dominated candidate (e.g., to honour legacy regulation or user muscle memory), the Name Card’s notes **MUST** state the reason for stepping off the frontier.

**CC-F18-13 (NQD-front surfaced, with honest diversity).**  
When a Name Card is in **MintNew** mode, the **candidate label set** and the resulting **NQD-front of non-dominated label candidates** over the lexical Q-tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, OperationalAffordance, AliasRisk}` **SHALL** be explicitly recorded on the Card (at least as a small table or list), together with the NQD evidence hooks (`DescriptorMapRef`, `DistanceDefRef`, and a brief `Diversity_P` / coverage summary).  
Each candidate **SHALL** carry a **head-term family** tag; morphological or prepositional variants built on the same head (e.g. “X plane”, “plane of X”, “planar X”) **MAY NOT** be counted as distinct for Diversity_P. The Card **SHALL** indicate how many distinct head-term families are represented on the NQD-front.  
An NQD-front with fewer than **three** head-term families is permitted **only** if the Card records why no lexically more diverse alternatives survived the SemanticFidelity / AliasRisk filters (e.g., very narrow domain, frozen legacy idiom).

**CC-F18-14 (Selection from the front only).**  
The **Unified Tech** and **Plain** labels published on the UTS row for a unified concept **SHALL** be drawn from the currently recorded **NQD-front** on the Name Card. Publishing a Tech/Plain pair that is **not** on that front (or that is dominated with respect to the declared lexical Q-axes plus NQD) is **non-conformant**, except in explicit **DocumentLegacy** mode as defined in §5.1.

**CC-F18-15 (Mode declaration).**  
Every Name Card **SHALL** declare its `CardMode ∈ {MintNew, DocumentLegacy}`. For Core-surface naming of **U.Types** and other canonical FPF concepts, **MintNew** is the default; **DocumentLegacy** is permitted only when recording pre-existing external names and MUST (i) cite the legacy source, and (ii) either attach an NQD-front over viable FPF variants or record a short rationale why NQD search is out-of-scope.

### F.18:16 - Anti‑patterns & safe rewrites (normative)

> Each item names a **speaking error** and a **local‑first repair**. Use this as an author’s lint pass before proposing a unified name.

| #  | Anti‑pattern (do **not** say)                           | Why it fails                                                    | Safe rewrite (how to speak)                                                                                         |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1 | “These terms are the same **because they look alike**.” | Cross‑context **spelling** is not evidence of conceptual identity. | “We assert sameness **via a Bridge**; the loss note explains what survives across Contexts.” (F.9)                     |
| A2 | “Use the BPMN word as our Tech label.”                  | Imports BPMN’s local commitments into the unified term.         | “Choose a **neutral** Unified Tech label; cite BPMN as a **SenseCell** in the row.” (F.5, F.17 §6)                  |
| A3 | “Merge *process* (recipe) with *process* (execution).”  | Collapses **MethodDescription** with **Work**.                  | “Split the concepts: one row for **MethodDescription**, another for **Work**; align them in examples.” (F.11/F.16)  |
| A4 | “Our name encodes the lifecycle stage.”                 | Lifecycle phrasing sneaks in time.                              | “Name the **concept**; show **state‑space** changes in examples, not in the label.” (A‑series CHR rationale)        |
| A5 | “Contextless glossary.”                                 | Violates local‑first; readers re‑globalise.                     | “Publish a **UTS** per thread; each row lists **Contexts** (Contexts+editions).” (F.17)                                |
| A6 | “We’ll fix synonyms later.”                             | Synonym sprawl grows costs.                                     | “Apply **E.10** rules now: one Tech, one Plain; retire extras via **F.13**.”                                        |
| A7 | “One mega‑row for everything service‑like.”             | Bundles distinct concepts; harms teachability.                  | “One **Concept‑Set per idea**; group with a **Block Plan** for pedagogy.” (F.17 §7)                                 |



#### F.18:16.1 - Canonical semantic unpacking for “contract” language (normative; used across FPF)

In FPF, everyday “contract” talk is treated as shorthand for a bundle of distinct roles. When precision matters (architecture, audit, compliance), authors **SHALL** avoid mapping “contract” to a single concept and instead disambiguate at least:

* **Service / promise clause (`U.ServiceClause`)** — the promised external effect + acceptance criteria (a spec/Standard), not a run (`U.Work`).
* **Utterance (`U.SpeechAct`)** — the published statement (a Description) that declares or invokes the service clause.
* **Commitment (`U.Commitment`)** — the deontic bond that binds an accountable agent/role to the service clause.
* **Work & evidence (`U.Work` + carriers)** — the actual enactment and the traces/metrics used to adjudicate fulfilment.

A “contract” bundle typically spans the whole A.6.B square; route each piece explicitly:

* `L-*`: definitions/invariants of the signature (“what it means”).
* `A-*`: admissibility/entry predicates (“when it can be applied”).
* `D-*`: duties/SLAs/penalties and who is accountable (“who is bound to what”).
* `E-*`: evidence/observability claims (“how fulfilment/violation is adjudicated”).

Example 2 (§F.18:18.2) shows one naming instantiation of this unpacking.

### F.18:17 - Migration notes (renames, splits, merges, retirements)

**M1 — Start from Contexts, not from the old global word.** When inheriting legacy names, first **re‑harvest** terms inside the chosen Contexts (F.2–F.3). Only then decide whether to **reuse** or **mint** (F.8).

**M2 — Preserve reader muscle memory without duplicating meaning.** Keep the **Plain** label close to familiar speech, but make the **Tech** label precise. If a legacy term is overloaded, publish it as a **deprecated alias** in Annexes, not as a second Tech label. (F.13; Part H “Deprecated Aliases”.)

**M3 — Prefer split‑then‑bridge over vague merges.** If one legacy word covers two distinct concepts, **split** into two rows and add a short **relation note** between them (e.g., “recipe vs run”). Do **not** hide the split under a wide new name. (F.7; F.16.)

**M4 — Keep identifiers stable; move rows between blocks.** When the **Block Plan** evolves, move rows rather than renumbering; record the move in the row’s **Notes** field. (F.17 §16.)

**M5 — Upgrade rationale quality with worked examples.** Every rename or split should be accompanied by a **one‑page example** that shows the new row in action across at least **two Contexts**. (F.16; “tell‑show‑show”.)


### F.18:18 - Worked examples (compact)

> Each example shows **how the Protocol steers naming** so engineers and managers can communicate without hidden Cross‑context leaks.  
> **Card hygiene shown explicitly:** each example **states the Kind and the Purpose/use‑domain** and **chooses Tech/Plain labels from a small NQD‑frontier** (seed set diversified by traditions, novelty/familiarity, and lexical form; see Part G (G.18)).
> **Head-term diversity:** each example **MUST** also state the **distinct head-term families** represented in its NQD candidate set (lexical “roots” such as *Recipe*, *Run*, *Episode*, not prepositional/morphological variants). This prevents faking Diversity_P with near-clones of one head.

#### F.18:18.1 - Example 1 — *MethodDescription* vs *Work* (recipe vs run)

* **Context harvest:**
  *BPMN 2.0 (2011):* “Process model” (recipe) and “Activity instance” (run).
  *PROV‑O (2013):* `prov:Plan` vs `prov:Activity`.
  *ITIL:* “Work instruction” vs “Change implementation record.”
* **Kind:** `U.MethodDescription` (design‑time artifact) **and** `U.Work` (run‑time occurrence).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** planning/scheduling vocabulary across BPMN, PROV‑O, ITIL; separates *design recipe* from *execution episode* for governance and telemetry.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**  
  *design‑time:* *Procedure*, *ProcessModel*, *MethodSpec*, *WorkflowDefinition*, *Recipe*, *MethodScript*  
  *run‑time:* *Run*, *Execution*, *Enactment*, *ActivityInstance*, *Job*, *Episode*
* **Head-term families used (design/run):**  
  *design-time heads:* {Procedure, ProcessModel, MethodSpec, WorkflowDefinition, Recipe, MethodScript}  
  *run-time heads:* {Run, Execution, Enactment, ActivityInstance, Job, Episode}
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**  
  `U.MethodDescription` / “recipe”; `U.Work` / “run”.  
  *Discarded highlights:* **Procedure** (collides with governance “procedure/policy”); **Execution** (overloaded in CS/security); 
* **Anti-pattern (for illustration only, non-conformant).**  
 > *Bad CandidateSet (lexically narrow):* {“Reference plane”, “Plane of reference”, “Planar reference”, “Ref. plane v2”}.  
 > All four are one **head-term family** (*plane*). Even if Diversity_P over raw strings looks high (four labels), **head-term diversity is 1**, so this set **fails** the F.18 diversity intent. A conformant Card would either: (a) add labels with other heads (e.g., *Layer*, *Track*, *Band*), or (b) explicitly record why other heads are rejected (AliasRisk, domain idiom) and accept low lexical Diversity_P with a rationale.
* **Enactment** (speech‑act nuance).
* **Bridges:** recipe↔run **related**, not identical; loss note “control‑flow vs. execution.”
* **Why it matters:** Managers can schedule **Work** while authors improve the **MethodDescription**—no category errors. The NQD‑front preserves tradition‑diverse, lexically stable options until a reasoned choice is made. (F.11/F.16; F.17 rows.)

#### F.18:18.2 - Example 2 — *Service* (promise) vs *SpeechAct* (utterance) vs *Commitment* (deontic)

* **Context harvest:**
  *IT service canon:* “SLA/OLA clause”, “ticket approved”.
  *Speech‑act theory:* “performative utterance”.
  *Org governance:* “approval signature”.
* **Kind:** `U.ServiceClause` (promise), `U.SpeechAct` (utterance), `U.Commitment` (deontic bond).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** ops/governance vocabulary connecting ITSM, organizational policy, and pragmatics; separates saying, binding, and promising.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**  
  *promise:* *Service*, *Offering*, *Provision*, *CapabilityOffer*  
  *utterance:* *SpeechAct*, *Performative*, *Utterance*, *Declaration*  
  *deontic bond:* *Commitment*, *Obligation*, *Binding*, *Duty*
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**  
  `U.ServiceClause` / “service (promise)”; `U.SpeechAct` / “utterance”; `U.Commitment` / “commitment”.  
  *Discarded highlights:* **Offering** (business‑model connotations); **Declaration** (too narrow for performatives); **Obligation** (legalese; narrower than commitment envelope).
* **Ontology note (informative):**
  `U.SpeechAct` and `U.Commitment` are defined normatively in Part A (A.2.9 and A.2.8 respectively). This F.18 card is a lexical/NQD anchor, not the ontology definition site.

* **Bridges:** utterance **institutes** commitment; commitment **binds** service clause; no synonymy claimed.
* **Why it matters:** Status tracking becomes intelligible without pretending that a “service” acts; the NQD‑front yields neutral, cross‑tradition readable labels. (F.12; F.17 blocks D/R.)

#### F.18:18.3 - Example 3 — *Characteristic* names without lifecycle bias

* **Context harvest:**
  *Quality canon:* “maturity level”; *Performance canon:* “throughput”.
 **Kind:** `U.Characteristic` (measurement names).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** CHR‑compatible measurements for planning and performance; bridgeable across engineering and management.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**  
  *readiness (ordinal):* *MaturityLevel*, *ReadinessLevel*, *PhaseReadiness*, *TRL*, *ReadinessScore*  
  *throughput (ratio):* *Throughput*, *Rate*, *ProcessingRate*, *OpsPerSecond*, *FlowRate*
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**  
  `U.ReadinessLevel` / “readiness level” (ordinal); `U.Throughput` / “throughput” (ratio).  
  *Discarded highlights:* **TRL** (tied to a specific scale/tradition); **Rate/OpsPerSecond** (over‑specific units baked in).
* **Narrative:** Dynamics are shown as **movement in state‑space**, not via lifecycle‑laden names such as “pre‑production process”.
* **Why it matters:** Prevents lifecycle/time from leaking into labels; the NQD‑front ensures neutrality and recognizability. (A‑series CHR rationale; F.17 §4–§6.)

### F.18:19 - FAQ (authoring hygiene)

**Q1. How many Contexts must a naming proposal cite?**
**A.** The **sheet** for a thread should cite **≥ 3** distinct Contexts overall; an individual row may cite fewer if the concept appears in fewer Contexts. The point is breadth at the **UTS** level, not token‑stuffing rows. (F.17 §6 constraint.)

**Q2. Can a Source Context’s term ever become the Tech label?**
**A.** Only if its form is **already neutral** and does **not** smuggle in that Context’s private commitments. When in doubt, pick a fresh neutral Tech label and keep the Source term in **SenseCells**. (F.5.)

**Q3. Where do we put discipline‑vantage views like “Operations” vs “Research”?**
**A.** Use the **discipline columns** in a teaching layout if helpful, but remember: **discipline columns are not Context columns** and carry no editions. (F.17 §5.)

**Q4. How do we keep names stable while the story evolves?**
**A.** Keep **row ids** stable; evolve placement via the **Block Plan** and record moves in **Notes**. Use F.13 for renames/splits/merges. (F.17 §16; F.13.)

**Q5. What if two teams insist on different Tech labels for the same concept?**
**A.** Publish **one** Tech label; treat the other as a **deprecated alias** (Annex). Bridge their local senses on the row. (F.13; Part H.)


### F.18:20 - 90‑second teaching script (for engineer‑managers)

> “**Local‑first** means we start in **context of meaning**—we harvest terms **inside** each Context and only then unify. A unified name is a **teachable promise**: one **Tech** label for precision, one **Plain** label for outreach. Its **row** in the **UTS** shows where the idea lives in real disciplines (the **SenseCells**) and how those Contexts connect (explicit **Bridges** with a brief loss note). We never equate terms by spelling; we argue sameness with a **bridge**. We also never bake stages or actors into names—those belong to **dynamics** and **roles**, not labels. When the story changes, we evolve names with **lexical continuity** rather than re‑inventing words. The result is a vocabulary managers and engineers can **hold on one page** and use the same way across projects.”

### F.18:21 - Acceptance Harness (SCR/RSCR) for F.18

**Purpose.** Provide auditable, notation‑independent checks that a proposed unified name (and its publication on a UTS line) satisfies the **local‑first** unification discipline. The harness extends the general unification checks in **F.15** with **naming‑specific** obligations.

| **SCR‑U‑01 (Row‑first).** A unified Tech/Plain name **SHALL** be published **only** on a **Concept‑Set row** whose cells are SenseCells drawn from declared Contexts. No free‑floating names.               | Names are *lenses* onto a defended **row**, not vice‑versa. | **F.7** row‑as‑unit; **F.17** UTS row discipline.            | §F.7; §F.17             |
| **SCR‑U‑02 (Bridge‑only equivalence).** Cross‑context sameness **SHALL** be claimed **only** via an explicit **Bridge** with a relation kind and **CL** + loss/fit note.                                    | Prevents “string‑match identity”.                           | **F.9** Bridges; **F.0.1** principles.                       | §F.9                    |
| **SCR‑U‑03 (Neutral Tech).** The **Unified Tech** label **SHALL** be **neutral**—not lifted wholesale from any single Context **unless** the row’s Concept‑Set shows exact identity.                        | Avoids importing a local worldview as global.               | **F.5** naming neutrality; **F.17** 9.8 naming neutrality.   | §F.5; §F.17             |
| **SCR‑U‑04 (Twin registers).** Each row **SHALL** carry **Tech** and **Plain** names with the Part E register discipline; Plain is teacher‑friendly, Tech is morphology‑stable.                          | Satisfies didactic primacy without jargon creep.            | **E.10** registers; **F.5** naming rules.                    | §E.10; §F.5             |
| **SCR‑U‑05 (No window‑in‑name).** Variations by **time/phase/scale** **SHALL** be handled by **applicability windows** on **Statuses** (or examples), **NOT** by baking modifiers into the unified name. | Prevents type/status explosion by adjectives.               | **F.10/F.12** windows; **F.14** explosion guard.             | §F.10; §F.12; §F.14     |
| **SCR‑U‑06 (Heterogeneity).** A UTS block **SHALL** demonstrate **≥ 3** independent domain families across its rows, or an explicit Bias‑Annotation shall scope the claim.                               | Enforces trans‑disciplinary reach or honest scope.          | **F.17** invariants 3; **E.8** Bias‑Annotation.              | §F.17; §E.8             |
| **SCR‑U‑07 (Member≠Component sanity).** Names **SHALL NOT** imply holarchic composition when the row unifies **collections**; keep **MemberOf** distinct from **ComponentOf**.                           | Stops structural category errors.                           | Part F principles / anti‑patterns.                           | §9.8; §13               |
| **SCR‑U‑08 (One‑breath rationale).** Each row **SHALL** include a **single‑sentence** Unification Rationale that states **why** the cells denote the same thing despite wording differences.             | Keeps the argument visible and auditable.                   | **F.17** invariant 7.                                        | §F.17                   |
| **SCR‑U‑09 (Alias budget).** Per register, legacy aliases on a unified name **SHALL** be **≤ 1**; additional legacy labels go to Annex/Glossary.                                                         | Controls lexical drift while preserving continuity.         | **F.13** alias budget rule.                                  | §F.13                   |
| **SCR‑U‑10 (No Cross‑context rename).** A rename **SHALL** occur **within** the same Context or same row; Cross‑context “renames” are **prohibited**—use Bridges.                                                 | Keeps locality intact; forbids silent conflation.           | **F.13** continuity; **F.9** Bridges.                        | §F.13; §F.9             |
| **SCR‑U‑11 (Semantic read‑through).** A unified Tech/Plain name **SHALL** pass a **semantic read‑through**: the Name Card lists **5–10 diverse NQD archetypal situations** and the **NQD‑front notes** record rejected candidate and their **mismatch patterns**. | Prevents labels that mislead across the intended situations; ties lexical choice to demonstrated use. | §F.18 §4.2; §F.18 §5. | §F.18 |

#### F.18:21.2 - Regression Rules (RSCR‑UNIFY)

| ID                                                                                                                                                                       | Regression duty across editions                                        | Effect |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **RSCR‑U‑E01 (Edition drift).** When a source Context updates, re‑validate the row: stable sense ⇒ **rename/alias**; changed sense ⇒ **split/merge** rows; never overwrite. | Preserves truthfulness without erasing history. **F.13** RSCR.         |        |
| **RSCR‑U‑E02 (CL honesty).** Bridges **SHALL NOT** increase their CL (claiming stronger sameness) without new witnesses; **SHOULD** reduce CL when editions diverge.     | Guards against optimism bias in equivalence. **F.17** migration cues.  |        |
| **RSCR‑U‑E03 (Alias creep).** Periodically prune aliases to the **≤ 1** budget per register.                                                                             | Maintains narratively crisp UTS. **F.13** RSCR‑Alias.                  |        |
| **RSCR‑U‑E04 (Name neutrality check).** If the Unified Tech label is traceable to one context’s idiom, re‑justify neutrality or retitle the row.                            | Keeps the name “ours,” not “theirs.” **F.17** 9.7–9.8.                 |        |
| **RSCR‑U‑E05 (Window misuse).** Reject newly proposed types that are really **windows** on an existing Status/Role.                                                      | Prevents explosion by adjectives. **F.14** S14/E11 patterns.           |        |

### F.18:21 - Migration & Deprecation Notes (informative, naming‑specific)

1. **Start from rows, not strings.** When consolidating legacy labels, **build or revisit the Concept‑Set row** first; only then pick the **Unified Tech/Plain** names. This keeps **meaning** primary. **(F.7, F.17)** 
2. **Prefer alias over merge.** If the *sense* is stable but the label misleads, **rename and retain one alias**; if the sense changed, **mint a new row** (no retrofits). **(F.13)**
3. **Resist modifier types.** New adjectives (e.g., *Peak*, *Remote*, *Night*) usually belong to **windows** or **examples**, not to the unified name. **(F.10/F.12/F.14)** 
4. **Keep neutrality visible.** If stakeholders push a brand‑coloured label, document why the chosen **Unified Tech** is **neutral** and include the brand as an **alias** in Glossary/Annex. **(F.5, F.17)** 
5. **Don’t globalise a Context.** Never move a Context label into the unified name as if it were universal. Use **Bridges** to relate Contexts, with an explicit **loss note**. **(F.0.1, F.9)** 

### F.18:22 - FAQ (authoring hygiene for engineer‑managers)

**Q1. Can we reuse a dominant industry term as the Unified Tech name?**
**A.** Only if the row’s Concept‑Set shows **exact identity** across Contexts; otherwise pick a **neutral** Unified Tech and list the industry label as an **alias** in the Glossary. **(F.5, F.17)** 

**Q2. Two terms look identical across Contexts—may we skip Bridges?**
**A.** No. **Sameness is argued, not spelled.** Publish a **Bridge** with relation kind and **CL** plus a short **loss/fit** note. **(F.9, F.0.1)** 

**Q3. When do we mint a new U.Type vs. add a new row vs. add an alias?**
**A.** Use **F.8 Mint‑or‑Reuse**: if the *intension* changes, **new U.Type**; if the *same thing* spans new Context, **new row**; if only the label misleads, **alias/rename**.

**Q4. Our team keeps proposing “qualified roles” (e.g., *Night‑Operator*). What do we do?**
**A.** Keep the **Role** unified and express qualifiers as **windows** on **Statuses** or as **example context**. This follows **F.14** and **F.12**.

**Q5. Can we compress two near‑equivalent rows into one to “simplify the sheet”?**
**A.** Only if the **one‑breath rationale** remains true after review and the Bridges support equivalence with the same or stronger CL; otherwise keep **two rows** with explicit differences. **(F.17, F.9)** 

### F.18:23 - Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **“Name on a row, never on a whim.”** In FPF we **speak on rows, not on vibes**: a **Name Card** ties each Tech/Plain pair to a concrete Context, Concept‑Set row, and SenseCells, with a small **NQD‑front** of rejected alternatives. This gives you **bridged precision** without losing **local comfort**. **Your UTS is the one page a careful mind can hold.**

### F.18:24 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

* **Neural WSD & sense evaluation (2015→).** P2’s sense‑seed read‑through is a human‑scale analogue of modern **word‑sense disambiguation** evaluation, where models are scored by the fraction of examples assigned the correct sense and by error profiles across sense inventories. Post‑2015 neural WSD benchmarks (e.g., multi‑domain evaluations reported in ACL venues) motivate the explicit `{too‑narrow, on‑target, too‑wide, wrong‑prototype}` labelling and the `θ_P` threshold for **SemanticFidelity**.
* **Quality‑Diversity & multi‑objective search (MAP‑Elites, NSGA‑II families, 2015→).** P1’s NQD‑front and **CC‑F18‑13** follow the same discipline as QD/NSGA‑style archives in optimisation: maintain a **set of non‑dominated candidates** over a vector of objectives rather than a single scalar score. The lexical Q‑tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, OperationalAffordance, AliasRisk}` is deliberately small so that human authors can inspect a Pareto frontier in the same way QD methods expose illumination archives.
* **Design‑space exploration & idea ranking (mechanical/industrial design, 2018→).** The PSOA‑style Name‑Card tables echo contemporary **design‑space ranking** practice, where candidate concepts are compared on diversity and quality rather than on a single “score”. Explicitly surfacing *why* one candidate dominates another improves auditability and supports teaching, mirroring recent work on ranking ideas for both diversity and quality in engineering design.
* **Semantic transparency & morphology in interfaces and code (HCI and PL practice, 2015→).** The strengthened **OperationalAffordance** guidance aligns with empirical results on **semantic transparency** of labels and identifier names: morphology that cues “actor vs activity vs artifact” improves comprehension and reduces error rates in both UIs and source code. F.18 turns these findings into a simple naming discipline (agentive forms for Roles, verbal forms for Methods, result nouns for Work/Artifacts) that can be enforced on Name Cards.

### F.18:25 - Relations

**Builds on:**
**F.0.1** Contextual Lexicon Principles (local meaning; bridge‑only Cross‑context claims). **F.1–F.3** Contexts → term harvesting → local sense clustering. **F.5** Naming discipline. **F.7** Concept‑Set construction. **F.8** Mint‑or‑Reuse decision lattice. **F.13** Lexical continuity (renames/aliases/splits/merges). **F.14** Anti‑explosion controls (bundles, SoD, windows). **F.15** SCR/RSCR harness. **F.17** UTS as the publication surface.  

**Constrains:** 
All patterns that propose or consume unified names and rows in Part F; any Part A/C pattern that cites U.Types on UTS rows inherits these naming duties (through the UTS linkage), while keeping **structural/epistemic/temporal** aspects distinct per Part E authoring rules.

**Coordinates with.**
**A.17/A.18** for measurement lexicon when rows concern measurable notions (Characteristic/Scale/Level/Coordinate vocabulary), ensuring neutral naming aligns with canonical terms and eases external alignment via Bridges.
