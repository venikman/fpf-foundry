## A.15.1 - U.Work
> Implementation note (local tooling): When `agent_session`, `agent_model`, or `agent_type` inputs are provided, the reference implementation adds an `agent_metadata` block to the U.Work record.

### A.15.1:1 - Problem Frame

After we have agreed **who is assigned** (via **Role assignment**), **what they can do** (via **Capability**), and **how in principle** it should be done (via **Method/MethodDescription**), we still need a precise concept for **what actually happened** in real time and space.

That concept is **`U.Work`**: the **dated run‑time occurrence** of enacting a MethodDescription by a specific performer under a Role assignment, with concrete parameter bindings, resource consumption, and outcomes, **anchored to a domain referent that actually changes** (asset/product/dataset) — **not** merely the manipulation of records about that referent. Managers care about Work because it is the **only place** where cost, time, defects, and evidence are **real**. Architects care because Work ties plans and specs to accountable execution.

### A.15.1:2 - Problem (what breaks without a clean notion of Work)

1. **Plan/run confusion.** Schedules and diagrams get mistaken for “the process,” so audits and KPIs become fiction.
2. **Spec/run conflation.** A method description (code/SOP) is reported as if it were an execution; conversely, logs are treated as recipes.
3. **Who/when leakage.** People and calendars are baked into specs; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **Resource dishonesty.** Energy/money/tool wear are booked to methods or roles, not to actual runs; costing and sustainability metrics drift.
5. **Mereology muddle.** Teams hand‑wave over “sub‑runs,” retries, overlaps, or long‑running episodes; roll‑ups double‑count or miss work.

### A.15.1:3 - Forces (what the definition must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain detail** | One Work notion for surgery, welding, ETL, proofs, lab cycles—while letting each keep its vocabulary. |
| **Granularity vs. aggregation**    | Atomic runs vs. composite operations; we need roll‑up without double‑count.                           |
| **Concurrency vs. order**          | Parallel/overlapped activities need clear part/overlap semantics.                                     |
| **Identity vs. retries**           | A failed attempt, a retry, and a resumed episode—what is “the same” work?                             |
| **Time realism vs. simplicity**    | We need intervals and coverage but cannot bury users in temporal logic notation.                      |

### A.15.1:4 - Solution — define `U.Work` as the accountable, dated occurrence

#### A.15.1:4.1 - Definition

**`U.Work`** is a **4D occurrence holon**: a **dated run‑time enactment** of a `U.MethodDescription` by a performer designated through a `U.RoleAssignment`, **executed within a concrete `U.System/SubSystem`**, inside a `U.BoundedContext`, that binds concrete parameters, consumes/produces resources, and leaves an auditable trace.
Each `U.Work` is a **morphism** `Δ` on a declared **state‑plane** (`StatePlaneRef`), mapping ⟨**pre‑state**, **inputs**⟩ to ⟨**post‑state**, **outputs**⟩ for one or more **affected referents**.

> **Memory aid:** *Work = “how it went this time”* (dated, resourced, accountable).

#### A.15.1:4.2 - Core anchors (conceptual descriptors; not a data schema)

When you describe a Work instance in a review, answer these prompts:

1. **Window** — start/end timestamps (and, where relevant, location/asset).
2. **Spec** — `isExecutionOf → U.MethodDescription` (the description actually followed; **edition pinned** if applicable).
3. **Performer** — `performedBy → U.RoleAssignment` (which **holder#role\:context** acted).
4. **Parameters** — concrete values bound for this run (from the **MethodDescription** parameter declarations).
5. **Inputs/Outputs** — material/information artifacts read/written, products/services delivered.
6. **Resources** — energy, materials, machine time, money (the **only** place we book them).
7. **Outcome** — success/failure classes, quality measures, acceptance verdicts (**map‑then‑compare** per **ComparatorSet** under **CG‑Spec**; pin editions).
8. **Links** — predecessor/successor/overlap relations to other Work, and step/run nesting (if part of a bigger operation).
9. **Context** — the bounded context(s) under which this run is judged (normally inherited from the MethodDescription and RoleAssigning; see A.15 for cross‑checks).
10. **Effect (Δ)** — `affected → {referent(s)}` + **pre‑state anchor** and **post‑state anchor** (or a declared **Δ‑predicate** evaluated on evidence) on the declared state‑plane (**StatePlaneRef**).
11. **System** — `executedWithin → U.System` (the operational system/sub‑system accountable for the occurrence; **mandatory**).
12. **Evidence & Telemetry (optional)** — if the run feeds **G.11** refresh or QD/OEE archives, cite **PathId/PathSliceId** and the active **policy‑id** used for illumination; do not elevate telemetry into dominance without CAL policy.

#### A.15.1:4.3 - Clear distinctions (the four‑slot grammar in action)

| You are pointing at…                          | The right FPF concept  | Litmus                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The **recipe/code/diagram**                   | **MethodDescription**         | Is it knowledge on a carrier?                                   |
| The **semantic “way of doing”**               | **Method**             | Same Standard across notations?                                 |
| The **assignment** (“who is being what”)     | **Role → RoleAssigning** | Can be reassigned without changing the system?                  |
| The **ability** (“can do within bounds”)      | **Capability**         | Would remain even if not assigned?                             |
| The **dated occurrence** with logs, resources | **Work**               | Did it happen at (t₀, t₁), consume resources, produce outcomes? |
| The **state change caused this time**         | **Work.Δ**             | Did the referent move from pre→post on the declared state‑plane? |

#### A.15.1:4.4 - Publication (MVPK guard‑rails for `U.Work`) — *normative*

Publication of `U.Work` across MVPK faces **must** be a typed projection that does **not** mutate intensional semantics (A.7; E.17). Concretely:

1. **No new claims.** Faces (**PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane**) **SHALL NOT** introduce properties beyond the `U.Work` intensional arrow; they **project** presence‑pins only (time window, performer, spec, parameter‑binding occurrence, resource ledger presence, acceptance verdict presence). Numeric/comparable content appears **only** with pins (see 4.4‑4.5 below); **“signature”** is banned on faces.
2. **No Γ‑leakage.** Faces **MUST NOT** smuggle Γ semantics (union/hull/overlap policy, budget algebra) into prose; whenever aggregation is shown, the face **cites** the Γ‑operator and policy‑id used. Compute totals outside the face per B.1; faces carry **references**, not implied Γ rules.
3. **No I/O re‑listing.** Per MVPK, faces **do not duplicate** intensional I/O lists. They show **presence‑pins** and **anchors** to carriers/lanes/editions only (E.17 §5.4).
4. **Lawful orders (sets).** Where a `U.Work` face presents any **comparison or ranking across runs** (e.g., acceptance classes, parity/benchmark inserts), the face **must**: (i) compare **after mapping** via a declared **ComparatorSet**; (ii) **return sets** (Pareto/Archive) when order is partial; (iii) **forbid** hidden scalarization/ordinal means (cf. G.9).
5. **Comparator/Transport edition pins.** Any numeric/comparable statement on a `U.Work` face **MUST** pin the **CG‑Spec**/**ComparatorSet** edition(s) and, where scale/plane conversion occurs, the **UNM.TransportRegistry** edition (**Φ**/**Φ^plane** policy‑ids). Cross‑context/plane crossings **route penalties to R‑lane only** (Bridge id + Φ) (cf. E.17; G.9).
6. **Cross‑stance citations.** Any citation whose **stance** differs from the citing `U.Work` face (different `DesignRunTag`, `ReferencePlane`, or `CtxState.locus`) **MUST** carry **BridgeCard + UTS row** (with locus/plane notes and CL routing).
7. **No surrogate‑run creation.** Faces **MUST NOT** synthesize “virtual runs” from reconstructed records alone; a face may reference only `U.Work` instances that meet Δ‑anchoring in §4.2/§8.

#### A.15.1:4.5 - Crossing visibility & stance tags (work publication discipline) — *normative*

* **Stance.** `U.Work` is a **run-time occurrence** (DesignRunTag = run). Any face that cites **design-time** artefacts (e.g., ComparatorSet, CG-Spec editions, TransportRegistryΦ) is making a **cross-stance/cross-Context** reference and therefore **MUST** publish a **BridgeCard + UTS row** and record **Φ(CL)/Φ^plane** policy-ids; **penalties reduce `R_eff` only**.  
* **Binding discipline.** **Launch values bind only here** (occurrence). Plan-time proposals remain proposals; do not back-fill plan faces with run-time bindings. **Pre/post state anchors bind here** (pre at start; post at completion or at declared checkpoints).

### A.15.1:5 - Work mereology (how runs form holarchies)

We adopt a **4D extensional** stance for occurrences: a Work is identified primarily by its **spatiotemporal extent** and its execution anchors (spec used, performer, parameterization). This avoids double‑counting and keeps aggregation sound. FPF adapts insights from BORO/constructive ontologies to Work while staying practical.

#### A.15.1:5.1 - Parts and wholes of Work (design‑neutral, run‑time facts)

* **Temporal‑part (`TemporalPartOf_work`).** A proper **time‑slice** of a Work (e.g., the first 10 minutes of a 2‑hour run). Useful for monitoring and SLAs.
* **Episode‑part (`EpisodeOf_work`).** A **resumption fragment** after an interruption (same run identity if policy deems it one episode; see 5.5).
* **Operational‑part (`OperationalPartOf_work`).** A **sub‑run** that enacts a **factor** of the Method/Spec (e.g., “incision” run within “appendectomy” run), possibly **overlapping** with others in time.
* **Parallel‑part (`ConcurrentPartOf_work`).** Two sub‑runs that **overlap** in their windows, coordinated by the same higher‑level run.

**Didactic rule:** **Method composition ≠ proof of Work decomposition.** Sub‑runs often map to method factors, but retries, batching, pipelining, and failures make the mapping non‑isomorphic.

#### A.15.1:5.2 - Key relations among Work

* **`precedes/happensBefore`** — strict partial order on Work windows.
* **`overlaps`** — intervals intersect but neither contains the other.
* **`contains/within`** — one Work’s window contains another’s.
* **`causedBy/causes`** — pragmatic causal links (e.g., a rework caused by a failed inspection run).
* **`retryOf`** — a new Work instance re‑attempting the same MethodDescription with revised parameters.
* **`resumptionOf`** — a Work episode that **continues** an interrupted run (policy decides identity; see 5.5).

These relations are **run‑time facts**, not design assumptions.

#### A.15.1:5.3 - Operators for roll‑ups (Γ\_time and Γ\_work)

* **Temporal coverage — `Γ_time(S)`**
  For a set `S` of Work parts, returns a **coverage interval set** (union of intervals) or, when required, the **convex hull** `[min t₀, max t₁]`. Use **union** for utilization; use **hull** for lead time.
  *Properties:* idempotent, commutative, monotone under set inclusion.

* **Resource aggregation — `Γ_work(S)`**
  For a set `S` of Work parts, returns the **aggregated resource ledger** (materials, energy, time, money) with de‑duplication rules for shared/overlapped parts (context‑declared).
  *Properties:* additive on **disjoint** parts; requires **overlap policy** otherwise (e.g., attribute costs to the parent once, not to each child).

**Manager’s tip:** Pick the coverage operator that matches your KPI: **union** for machine utilization; **hull** for calendar elapsed; never mix silently.

#### A.15.1:5.4 - Identity of a Work (extensional criterion, pragmatically framed)

Two Work records refer to the **same Work** iff, in the relevant context:

* their **time–space extent** is the same (within declared tolerance),
* they link to the **same `MethodDescription`**,
* they have the **same performer** (`U.RoleAssignment`), and
* they bind the **same parameters** (or declared‑equivalent values).

If any of these differ (or the context declares equivalence absent), they are **distinct** Work instances (e.g., a retry).

#### A.15.1:5.5 - Interruptions, retries, resumptions (episode policy)

* **Retry:** **new Work** with its own window and parameters; link via `retryOf`.
* **Resumption:** **same Work identity** split into **episodes** if the context’s **episode policy** declares so (e.g., “power loss under 5 minutes keeps identity”).
* **Rework:** **new Work** caused by a failure in earlier Work; link via `causedBy`.

**Why it matters:** plans, costs, and quality stats depend on whether you treat a disruption as **one episode** or **a new run**. Declare the policy **in the bounded context**.

#### A.15.1:5.6 - Compositionality of effects (Δ)

For any Work with parts, the **effect of the whole** must be the **rules‑declared composition** of the effects of its parts plus any declared overheads/residuals. Composition must align with the overlap rules used by `Γ_work` (e.g., no double‑count of shared fixed costs, and consistent attribution of variable deltas).

### A.15.1:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

#### A.15.1:6.1 - Surgical case (overlap and episodes)

* **Top run:** `Appendectomy_Case#2025‑08‑10T09:05–11:42`.
* **Spec:** `Appendectomy_v5` (MethodDescription).
* **Performer:** `OR_Team_A#SurgicalTeamRole:Hospital_2025` (RoleAssigning).
* **Operational parts:** `Incision` (09:15–09:22), `Exploration` (overlaps with monitoring), `Closure` (11:10–11:35).
* **Episode:** brief power dip 10:02–10:07 → **resumptionOf** same run (per hospital policy).
* **Γ\_time:** union for OR utilization; hull for patient lead time.
* **Γ\_work:** totals consumables and staff time once (no double‑count for overlapping sub‑runs).

#### A.15.1:6.2 - ETL pipeline (parallelism and retries)

* **Top run:** `ETL_Nightly_2025‑08‑11T01:00–01:47`.
* **Spec:** `ETL_v12.bpmn`.
* **Performer:** `ETL_Runtime#TransformerRole:DataOps_2025`.
* **Parallel parts:** `Extract_A` ‖ `Extract_B`; `Transform` starts when either completes (overlap).
* **Retry:** `Load` failed at 01:36; retried with batch size ↓ — **new Work** linked via `retryOf`.
* **Γ\_time:** hull for SLA, union for cluster utilization.
* **Γ\_work:** sum compute minutes; attribute storage I/O once at the parent.

#### A.15.1:6.3 - Thermodynamic cycle (work as a path)

* **Run:** `Carnot_Cycle_Run#2025‑08‑09T13:00–13:06`.
* **Spec:** `Carnot_Cycle_Spec` (MethodDescription with Dynamics model).
* **Performer:** `LabRig_7#TransformerRole:ThermoLab`.
* **Work identity:** the **path in state‑space** traced during the interval; outputs: heat/work tallies.
* **Γ\_time:** straightforward interval; **Γ\_work:** integrates energy exchange; no “steps” required.

### A.15.1:7 - Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Prag`, `Arch`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; temporal semantics and episode policy are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Gives FPF a clean, actionable notion of **occurrence** compatible with `U.RoleAssignment` / **Role Enactment** (A.2.1; A.15) and with 4D extensional thinking, so that costing, quality, and audit rest on **runs**, not on plans or recipes.

### A.15.1:8 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A15.1‑1 (Strict distinction).**
`U.Work` is a **dated run‑time occurrence**. It is **not** a `U.Method` (semantic way), **not** a `U.MethodDescription` (description), **not** a `U.Role/RoleAssigning` (assignment), and **not** a `U.WorkPlan` (plan/schedule).

**CC‑A15.1‑2 (Required links).**
Every `U.Work` **MUST** reference:
(a) `isExecutionOf → U.MethodDescription` (the spec followed; **edition pinned**),
(b) `performedBy → U.RoleAssignment` (the assigned performer in context), and
(c) `executedWithin → U.System/SubSystem` (the operational system accountable for the occurrence).

**CC‑A15.1‑3 (Time window).**
Every `U.Work` **MUST** carry a closed interval `[t_start, t_end]` (or an explicitly marked open end for in‑flight work) and, where relevant, location/asset.

**CC‑A15.1‑4 (Context anchoring & judgement).**
A `U.Work` **MUST** be judged inside a declared **`U.BoundedContext`** (the **judgement context**).

* By default, the judgement context is **the context of the referenced MethodDescription**.
* If `performedBy` references a RoleAssigning in a different context, there **MUST** exist an explicit **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** or policy stating cross‑context acceptance. Otherwise, the Work is **non‑conformant** in that context.

**CC‑A15.1‑4b (State‑plane anchoring).**
Each `U.Work` **MUST** declare a `StatePlaneRef` for its Δ‑judgement.

**CC‑A15.1‑5 (RoleAssigning validity).**
The `performedBy` RoleAssigning’s `timespan` **MUST** cover the Work interval. If it does not, the Work is **invalid** or must be re‑judged in a context that allows retroactive assignments.

**CC‑A15.1‑6 (Parameter binding).**
Parameters declared by the **MethodDescription** **MUST** have concrete values bound **at Work creation/start** and recorded with the Work. Defaults in the spec do not satisfy this requirement.

**CC‑A15.1‑7 (Capability check).**
All capability thresholds stated by the Method/MethodDescription **MUST** be checked against the **holder** in `performedBy` **at the time of execution** (or at defined checkpoints). Violations must be flagged on the Work outcome.

**CC‑A15.1‑8 (Acceptance criteria).**
Success/failure and quality grades **MUST** be determined by the acceptance criteria declared (or referenced) by the **MethodDescription**/**CG‑Spec** **in the judgment context**. The verdict is recorded on the Work.

**CC‑A15.1‑9 (Resource honesty).**
All consumptions and costs (energy, materials, machine‑time, money, tool wear) **SHALL** be booked **only** to `U.Work` (not to Method, MethodDescription, Role, or Capability). Estimates may live in specs; **actuals** live in Work.

**CC‑A15.1‑10 (Mereology declared).**
If a Work has parts, the chosen **part relation(s)** must be declared (temporal‑part, episode‑part, operational‑part, concurrent‑part). Ambiguous mixtures are forbidden.

**CC‑A15.1‑11 (Γ\_time selection).**
For any roll‑up, the judgement context **MUST** declare which temporal coverage operator applies: **union** (utilization) or **convex hull** (lead time). Silent mixing is prohibited.

**CC‑A15.1‑12 (Γ\_work aggregation).**
Aggregation of resource ledgers across Work parts **MUST** specify an **overlap policy** (e.g., “attribute shared machine‑time to parent only”) to prevent double‑counting.

**CC‑A15.1‑13 (Identity & retries).**
A retry **MUST** be modeled as a **new Work** linked via `retryOf`. Interruptions that are treated as the **same run** must be modeled as **episodes** (`resumptionOf`) per a context‑declared **episode policy**.

**CC‑A15.1‑14 (Concurrency & ordering).**
Overlaps and precedences among Work **MUST** use interval relations (`overlaps`, `precedes`, `contains/within`). Implicit “step order” claims are not admissible evidence.

**CC‑A15.1‑15 (Cross‑context evidence).**
If a Work is to be accepted in multiple contexts (e.g., regulatory + operational), either:
(a) re‑judge it in each context, or
(b) provide Bridges that map acceptance criteria/units/roles; never assume cross‑context identity by name.

**CC‑A15.1‑16 (Spec changes during run).**
If the MethodDescription version changes mid‑run, the Work **MUST** either:
(a) split into episodes bound to respective specs, or
(b) record an explicit **spec override** event in the judgement context. Silent substitution is forbidden.

**CC‑A15.1‑17 (Distributed performers).**
If multiple RoleAssignings jointly perform the same top‑level Work (e.g., multi‑agent orchestration), the Work **MUST** either:
(a) designate a **lead RoleAssigning** and list others as **concurrent parts**, or
(b) be modeled as a **parent Work** with child Works per RoleAssigning.

**CC‑A15.1‑18 (Logs ≠ Work by themselves).**
Logs/telemetry are **evidence** for a Work; they **do not constitute** a Work unless bound to (spec, performer, time window) and judged in a context.

**CC‑A15.1‑19 (Affected referent).** Each `U.Work` **MUST** name at least one affected referent (e.g., `U.Asset`, product/batch, dataset/document) via `affected → {…}`.

**CC‑A15.1‑20 (State‑change witness).** Each `U.Work` **MUST** carry either (a) explicit **pre‑state**/**post‑state** anchors on the declared state‑plane or (b) a **Δ‑predicate** that can be evaluated on evidence. Trivial “no‑op” runs **MUST** be flagged as such.

**CC‑A15.1‑21 (World anchoring vs. record‑handling).** A run whose only effect is copying/reformatting records **does not** qualify as `U.Work` unless the judgment context declares those records to be the **product referent** (e.g., data‑product manufacture).

**CC‑A15.1‑22 (System anchoring).** Each `U.Work` **MUST** declare `executedWithin → U.System/SubSystem`; if different from the asset of change, keep `affected` explicit.

**CC‑A15.1‑23 (Compositionality of Δ).** For composite Work, the parent effect **MUST** be the declared composition of child effects under the same overlap policy as `Γ_work`.

**CC‑A15.1‑24 (No new claims on faces).** MVPK faces for `U.Work` **SHALL NOT** add properties/claims beyond the intensional arrow; numeric/comparable content **MUST** include unit/scale/reference‑plane/**EditionId** pins; the term **“signature”** is banned on faces.

**CC‑A15.1‑25 (No Γ‑leakage).** Faces **MUST** reference Γ operators/policies by id when showing aggregates; they **MUST NOT** encode aggregation semantics in prose or imply defaults. Γ lives in Part B; faces carry **pinned references** only.

**CC‑A15.1‑26 (No I/O re‑listing).** Faces **MUST NOT** restate intensional I/O; publish **presence‑pins** and anchors only (per MVPK §5.4).

**CC‑A15.1‑27 (Lawful orders; return sets).** Any across‑run comparison presented on a `U.Work` face **MUST** use a declared **ComparatorSet** (map‑then‑compare), **return sets** when order is partial, and **forbid** hidden scalarization/ordinal means.

**CC‑A15.1‑28 (Comparator/Transport pins).** Any numeric/comparable acceptance or KPI on a `U.Work` face **MUST** pin `ComparatorSet.edition`, `CG‑Spec.edition`, and (where conversions occur) `TransportRegistry.edition` with **Φ/Φ^plane** policy‑ids; Bridge ids are mandatory for cross‑context/plane reuse; **penalties → R only**.

**CC‑A15.1‑29 (Telemetry hooks, when applicable).** If a Work instance feeds **G.11** or QD/OEE portfolios, it **SHALL** cite `PathId/PathSliceId` and the active **policy‑id** in its evidence; illumination remains **report‑only telemetry** unless CAL explicitly promotes it.

### A.15.1:9 - Temporal & Aggregation Semantics (normative operators & invariants)

#### A.15.1:9.1 - Temporal coverage `Γ_time`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or Work parts.
* **Output:** either (a) the **union** of their intervals, or (b) the **convex hull** `[min t_start, max t_end]`—**as declared by context** and KPI.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Idempotent:** `Γ_time(S ∪ S) = Γ_time(S)`
  * **Commutative:** order of elements irrelevant
  * **Monotone:** if `S ⊆ T` then coverage(S) ⊆ coverage(T) (for union) or hull(S) ⊆ hull(T) (for hull)
* **Usage guidance:**

  * Use **union** for **utilization/availability** (how much of the clock time the asset was actually busy).
  * Use **hull** for **lead/cycle time** (elapsed from first touch to last release).
  * **Manager’s tip:** Write the choice near the KPI; many disputes are just a hidden union‑vs‑hull mismatch.

#### A.15.1:9.2 - Resource aggregation `Γ_work`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or parts with resource ledgers.
* **Output:** an **aggregated ledger** (materials, energy, machine‑time, money, tool wear) with explicit **overlap policy**.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Additivity on disjoint parts:** if intervals/resources are disjoint by policy, totals add.
  * **No double‑count:** overlapping costs must follow the declared policy (e.g., count once at parent).
  * **Traceability:** each aggregated figure must be reconcilable to contributing Work IDs.
* **Typical policies:**

  * **Parent‑attribution:** shared fixed costs at parent; variable costs at children.
  * **Pro‑rata by wall‑time:** split overlaps by relative durations.
  * **Driver‑based:** allocate by a declared driver (e.g., CPU share, weight, priority).

### A.15.1:10 - Cross‑context checks (MethodDescription ↔ RoleAssigning ↔ Work)

When a Work is recorded, perform these **three quick checks**:

1. **Spec–Context Check.** Does `isExecutionOf` refer to a MethodDescription **defined in** the judgement context (or bridged to it)?

   * If **no**, the Work is **out‑of‑context**; either change context or add a Bridge.

1. **RoleAssigning–Context Check.** Is `performedBy`’s RoleAssigning **valid in** the same context (or bridged)?

   * If **no**, the Work is **unassigned** for that context; remedy via a valid RoleAssigning or a policy exception.

1. **Standard–Outcome Check.** Do the Work’s inputs/outputs and metrics satisfy the **acceptance criteria** from the spec **as interpreted in that context**?

   * If **no**, the Work **fails** or is “conditionally accepted” per context policy.

> **Manager’s mnemonic:** Context, assignment, Standard → **CAC**. Fail any → the Work is not acceptable *here* (perhaps acceptable elsewhere).

### A.15.1:11 - Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“The log is the process.”** Dumping telemetry without binding (spec, performer, context) → **Not Work**. Create a Work, link the log as evidence.
* **Record‑only transforms.** ETL/replication of records with no declared affected referent (product/dataset as product) → **Not Work** in this context; either declare the dataset as the product referent or move it to `U.WorkPlan`/operations‑support.
* **Silent cross‑context acceptance.** “Ops accepted it, so audit accepts it.” → Add a **Bridge** or re‑judge in audit context.
* **Spec drift in mid‑run.** Swapping SOP v5→v6 without recording → Split into episodes or record override.
* **Budget on the method.** Charging costs to Method or Role → Book **only** to Work; keep estimates in specs.
* **Part ambiguity.** Mixing retries, episodes, and operational parts with no declared relation → Choose and declare the part relation.
* **Union/hull confusion.** Changing KPI coverage silently between reports → Declare `Γ_time` policy per KPI.
* **Double‑count in overlaps.** Summing child and parent resource ledgers → Declare and apply an overlap policy.

### A.15.1:12 - Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Backfill links.** For existing logs, create Work records and attach `isExecutionOf` and `performedBy`.
2. **Name the context.** Pick the judgement context explicitly; add Bridges if multiple contexts must accept.
3. **Publish the episode policy.** Decide when an interruption keeps identity vs forces a new run.
4. **Choose Γ\_time per KPI.** Put “union” or “hull” in the KPI definition; stop arguing in meetings.
5. **Set an overlap policy.** Write one sentence on how shared costs are allocated; apply consistently.
6. **Pull plans out.** Move calendars to `U.WorkPlan`; let Work record actuals.
7. **Parameter blocks.** Make parameters explicit and bind them at start; your root‑cause analyses will get 10× easier.

### A.15.1:13 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                 | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Auditable reality.** Costs, time, and quality attach to concrete runs; root‑cause analysis and accountability improve. | **More records.** You create Work instances; mitigate with templates and automation.       |
| **Sound roll‑ups.** Γ\_time/Γ\_work turn roll‑ups from hand‑waving into declared policy; KPIs become comparable.         | **Policy discipline.** You must choose union vs hull and an overlap policy; write it once. |
| **Cross‑context clarity.** CAC checks prevent silent model drift; bridges make acceptance explicit.                      | **Bridge upkeep.** Keep mappings short and focused; review at releases.                    |
| **4D extensional coherence.** Parts/overlaps/retries stop double‑counting and identity confusion.                        | **Learning curve.** Teach episode vs retry; include examples in onboarding.                |

### A.15.1:14 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`; **U.System**; A.2 `U.Role`; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`; A.2.2 `U.Capability`; A.3.1 `U.Method`; A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription`.
* **Coordinates with:** A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment (the “four‑slot grammar”); B.1 Γ (aggregation) for resource/time operators; E‑cluster lexical rules (L‑PROC/L‑FUNC).
* **Informs:** Reporting/KPI patterns; Assurance/evidence patterns (Work as the anchor for audits); Scheduling patterns (`U.WorkPlan` ↔ `U.Work` deltas).

### A.15.1:15 - Didactic quick cards

* **What is Work?** *How it went this time* → dated, resourced, accountable.
* **Four‑slot grammar:** Who? **RoleAssigning**. Can? **Capability**. How? **Method/MethodDescription**. Did? **Work**.
* **CAC checks:** **Context** (judgement), **assignment** (valid RoleAssigning), **Standard** (acceptance criteria).
* **Roll‑ups:** `Γ_time = union` (utilization) or `hull` (lead time); `Γ_work` with a declared overlap policy.
* **Episodes vs retries:** same run split vs new run; write the policy.
* **Resource honesty:** actuals booked **only** to Work; estimates live in specs.
